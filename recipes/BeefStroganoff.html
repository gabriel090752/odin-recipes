            <h3>Ingredients</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>2 Tbsp salted butter, divided</li>
                <li>8 oz button mushrooms, sliced</li>
                <li>1 onion, thinly sliced</li>
                <li>1 lb sirloin steak, sliced thinly, against the grain</li>
                <li>2 Tbsp unbleached all-purpose flour</li>
                <li>1 c beef broth, (we prefer low sodium)</li>
                <li>½ tsp ground mustard seed, or 1 Tbsp whole grain mustard</li>
                <li>1 Tbsp tomato paste</li>
                <li>½ c sour cream</li>
                <li>½ tsp salt</li>
                <li>¼ tsp ground black pepper</li>
            </ul>
            <h3>Ingredients</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>In a large skillet, heat 1 Tbsp of butter. Saute the mushrooms in the butter over medium high heat for 2 minutes. Remove the mushrooms from the pan and set aside.  </li>
                <li>Add the remaining 1 Tbsp butter to the pan and heat until melted. Add the onions to the butter and saute for 1-2 minutes.  </li>
                <li>Toss the beef chunks with the flour and add them to the saute pan. Cook until browned, 2-3 minutes. </li>
                <li>Add the beef broth, mustard powder, and tomato paste to the saute pan along with the cooked mushrooms, scraping the bottom of the pan to pick up any stuck bits. </li>
                <li>Simmer the mixture over medium heat for 10-15 minutes, until the beef is cooked to your liking. </li>
                <li>Place the sour cream into a small bowl and mix a little of the broth from the skillet with the sour cream to warm it. Pour the warmed sour cream mixture into the saucepan and mix to combine. </li>
                <li>Taste the stroganoff and add the salt and pepper, to taste. </li>
                <li>Serve the stroganoff alongside of potatoes, rice, or noodles, of your choosing. </li>
            </ol>
